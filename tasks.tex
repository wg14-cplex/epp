\clause{Task execution}

\pnum
A task is permitted to execute
in either the invoking OS thread
or an OS thread implicitly created by the implementation
to support task execution.
Independent tasks executing in the same OS thread
are indeterminately sequenced with respect to one another.
Independent tasks executing in different OS threads
are unsequenced with respect to one another.
\footnote{TODO:
The expectation is that there is a direct mapping
from a thread managed by the C11
\tcode{thrd}
functions to an OS thread.
}

\pnum
When execution of an independent task completes,
execution
\defn{joins}
with its parent task.
The completion of a task synchronizes
with the completion of the associated task block,
or with the next execution of a sync statement
within the associated task block.
