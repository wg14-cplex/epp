This is the source for the CPLEX document "Extensions for parallel programming".

The document can be generated using the following command:

latexmk -pdf -silent cplexts

Note: On some systems (Mac), the previous comment will invoke pdflatex,
which does not work for this document.  In this case, one needs to
invoke lualatex directly.

Users of Windows should see WINDOWS.txt.
