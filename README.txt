This is the source for the CPLEX document "Extensions for parallel programming".

The document can be generated using the following command:

latexmk -pdf -silent cplexts

Note: On some systems (Mac), the previous comment will invoke pdflatex,
which does not work for this document.  In this case, build with this command:

latexmk -pdf -lualatex -silent cplexts

Users of Windows should see WINDOWS.txt.
